Weather forecast app. When the user opens the application, all data on the page refers to the user's current city. The search bar searches by city or ZIP code. The background image changes when the page content is updated or when you click the button to switch the background image in the control block.

Implemented additional functionality: translation of the map language, determine the exact location of the user, as well as voice search.
